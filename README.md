# Google Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) Playground

This __gRPC__ GitHub repository is used to analyze gRPC protocol with different scenario:

* localhost latency
* server-to-server latency
* server-to-server latency with encryption

## Create .proto artifacts

The Google Protocol buffer compiler *protoc* is used to create the Python programming languange specific Google procol buffer artifacts.

An *Order* of 25 - byte is used for the prototyping. See *order.proto* file: 

``` python
message Order {
  int64 instrumentID = 1;
  int64 price = 2;
  int64 quantity = 3;
  bool side = 4;
}
```

The corresponding Google protocol buffer Python artifacts are created by using:

``` shell
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --grpc_python_out=. --python_out=. order.proto
```

The generated Google protocol buffer Python artifacts are:

``` shell
order_pb2.py
order_pb2_grcp.py
```

## Certicate for encryption

The server cerificate is created by using *openssl* as follows:

``` shell
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
```

The private key is generated by using the *server.key*:

``` shell
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

The created certiciface can be verified by using *openssl -txt* command as follows:

``` shell
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
```

## Single gRPC Server
 
The single *gRPC server* runs with a threadpool with *10* workers to receive the incoming messages. 
The gRPC server receives the sent orders by the gRPC clients and replies with a *Boolean* that the order is received.

```python
python3 grpc_server.py --help
```

## Single gRPC Client

The *gRPC client* sends an *Order* by using the Google protocol buffer to the single gRPC server.  

## Multiple gRPC Clients

The *multiple gRPC clients* is used to simulate several *gRPC clients*. All gRPC clients are started in parallell.  
All gRPC clients is based on the same logic. They simply send an Order to the gRPC server. 

### Localhost test results

The single gRPC server and multiple gRPC clients run on the same local server (AWS).

```python
python3 grcp_clients.py --no-of-clients=100000 --count=1000000


Number of clients 100000 and number of order transactions 1000000
0 transactions and elapsed time 0.0016 in seconds
1000 transactions and elapsed time 0.2707 in seconds
2000 transactions and elapsed time 0.5320 in seconds
3000 transactions and elapsed time 0.7929 in seconds
4000 transactions and elapsed time 1.0512 in seconds
5000 transactions and elapsed time 1.3075 in seconds
6000 transactions and elapsed time 1.5661 in seconds
7000 transactions and elapsed time 1.8335 in seconds
8000 transactions and elapsed time 2.0970 in seconds
9000 transactions and elapsed time 2.3582 in seconds
10000 transactions and elapsed time 2.6195 in seconds
```

Several runs with different number of gRPC clients:

```python

transactions and elapsed time 0.2859 in seconds

transactions and elapsed time 27.7686 in seconds
```

### Server to Server test results

The gRPC server and multiple gRPC clients run on the different server (AWS - Red Hat 7).
